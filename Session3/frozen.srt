1
00:00:13,740 --> 00:00:17,100
The snow glows white on the mountain tonight,

2
00:00:17,100 --> 00:00:20,060
Not a footprint to be seen.

3
00:00:20,740 --> 00:00:26,960
A kingdom of isolation and it looks like I’m the queen.

4
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:34,740
The wind is howling like this swirling storm inside.

5
00:00:35,500 --> 00:00:41,540
Couldn’t keep it in; Heaven knows I tried.

6
00:00:42,400 --> 00:00:49,340
Don’t let them in, don’t let them see.
Be the good girl you always have to be.

7
00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:55,600
Conceal, don’t feel, don’t let them know.

8
00:00:55,740 --> 00:00:58,700
Well, now they know.

9
00:00:58,860 --> 00:01:05,740
Let it go, let it go
Can’t hold it back anymore

10
00:01:05,880 --> 00:01:19,840
Let it go, let it go
Turn away and slam the door
I don't care what they're going to say.

11
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:26,700
Let the storm rage on.
The cold never bothered me anyway.

12
00:01:31,260 --> 00:01:37,320
It's funny how some distance,
makes everything seem small.

13
00:01:37,540 --> 00:01:45,200
And the fears that once controlled me, can't get to me at all

14
00:01:45,440 --> 00:01:52,580
It's time to see what I can do,
to test the limits and break through.

15
00:01:52,580 --> 00:02:00,140
No right, no wrong, no rules for me.
I'm free!

16
00:02:00,140 --> 00:02:07,160
Let it go, let it go.
I am one with the wind and sky.

17
00:02:07,160 --> 00:02:14,480
Let it go, let it go.
You'll never see me cry.

18
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:25,120
Here l stand, and here I'll stay.
Let the storm rage on.

19
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:39,180
My power flurries through the air into the ground.

20
00:02:39,640 --> 00:02:46,400
My soul is spiraling in frozen fractals all around

21
00:02:46,680 --> 00:03:01,500
And one thought crystallizes like an icy blast
I'm never going back; the past is in the past!

22
00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:08,500
Let it go, let it go.
And I'll rise like the break of dawn.

23
00:03:08,500 --> 00:03:24,360
Let it go, let it go
That perfect girl is gone
Here I stand, in the light of day

24
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:29,800
Let the storm rage on

25
00:03:29,940 --> 00:03:33,160
The cold never bothered me anyway

26
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:40,620
